Subject: Request for Etsy API Key Approval

Dear Etsy API Team,

Iâ€™d like to request approval for an Etsy API key that I recently created through my Etsy account.

I am developing a small personal project that will allow me to access and analyze data from my own Etsy shop. Specifically, I'm building a local MCP (Message Control Protocol) server to interact with the Claude Desktop client that will help me query and monitor my shop's listings, sales, and creating draft shop listings.

This tool is strictly for personal use on my personal computer. I will not be sharing any data with third parties or using the API for any commercial purposes beyond managing my own shop.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
[Shop Name]
